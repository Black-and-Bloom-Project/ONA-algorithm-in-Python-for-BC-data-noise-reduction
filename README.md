ONA for Python - Noise reduction in Black Carbon data | version 02 (June 2020)

ONA is the Optimized Noise reduction Averaging (ONA) algorithm developed by Hagler et al. (2011) to reduce the occurence negative values of BC data while preserving the significant dynamics trends in the time series. More information about ONA can be found in:
Hagler GSW, Yelverton TLB, Vedantham R, Hansen ADA, Turner JR (2011) Post-processing Method to Reduce Noise while Preserving High Time Resolution in Aethalometer Real-time Black Carbon Data. Aerosol and Air Quality Research 11, 539â€“546. doi: 10.4209/aaqr.2011.05.0055
The original algorithm was developed in MatLab code and this script aims to implement it in Python code.
